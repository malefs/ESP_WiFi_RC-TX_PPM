## Description

Counterpart to [ESP-WiFi-RC-RCV](https://github.com/normbxl/ESP-WiFi-RC-RCV).

This is the transmitter implementation using a remote control's PPM signal as controller inputs.

Due to the ESP8266 lack of multiple ADC inputs this seemed a good chance to give an old Walker transmitter a second live.
